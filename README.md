# Smart-Blind-Assistant-Tool-for-Visually-Impaired-People
The visually impaired people will wear our customized made device like a normal spectacle/glass and that device will guide him or her when he or she is in the move. If any obstacles arrives in front of the visually impaired people that device will notify the visually impaired people with a sound and by hearing this sound he will control his movement. By Page | 2 this, the visually impaired people will move swiftly without thinking about the obstacles in front of him that might create a severe life-taking injury to him.

The presented system is designed and configured for practical use. The system is able to handle the
obstacle that may face the blind people. The system will handle the obstacle according to a specific
program, which is coded and installed in the Arduino UNO. When the ultrasonic sensor in the left detects
obstacle, right and front side, then Arduino send the message to the blind through buzzer. The buzzer
will have fixed into the ear of the visually impaired person so that the person can move easily by hearing
this soft sound. A simple, cheap, configurable and easy to handle electronic guidance system is proposed
to provide constructive assistant and support for blind and the visually impaired persons. The system is
designed, implemented, tested, and verified. Our results indicate that the system is efficient and unique
in its capability in specifying the source and distance of the objects that may encounter the blind. It is
able to scan areas left, right, and in front of the blind person regardless of its height or depth. The
ultrasonic sensor has been fully utilized in order to advance the mobility of the blind and visual impaired
people in safe and independent way. This system does not require any special training. This system also
resolves limitations that are related to the most of the movement problems that may influence the blind
people in their environment.
